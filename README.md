# UFOs
Technology: JavaScript Bootstrap and HTML
Background:
Developed a UFO Sightings webpage using JavaScript. The webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but we would like the table to be filtered even further. While it currently filters by the date, we would like to include the ability to filter by more column headers. The ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

Objectives:
The goals of this challenge are to create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
Update and deploy forEach (for loop) if necessary to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.

Recommendation for further development:
Need to add more data to the data.js file to include other countries to provide a global perspective on UFO sightings. This can be a collaborative resource where data in also inputed through a filtering system to increase the data collection.
